Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually&nbsp;<em>took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket</em>, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.</p><p class="p-7 block block_id_7 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="7">In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.</p><p class="p-8 block block_id_8 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="8">The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.</p><p class="p-9 block block_id_9 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="9">Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.</p><p class="p-10 block block_id_10 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="10">“Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!” (Which was very likely true.)</p><p class="p-11 block block_id_11 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="11">Down, down, down. Would the fall&nbsp;<em>never</em>&nbsp;come to an end? “I wonder how many miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a&nbsp;<em>very</em>&nbsp;good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about the right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?” (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)</p><p class="p-12 block block_id_12 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="12">Presently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right&nbsp;<em>through</em>&nbsp;the earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather glad there&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all the right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?” (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy&nbsp;<em>curtseying</em>&nbsp;as you’re falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) “And what an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.”</p><p class="p-13 block block_id_13 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="13">Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. “Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!” (Dinah was the cat.) “I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?” And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, “Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” and sometimes, “Do bats eat cats?” for, you see, as she couldn’t answer either question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, “Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?” when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.</p><p class="p-14 block block_id_14 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="14">Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, “Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it’s getting!” She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.</p><p class="p-15 block block_id_15 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="15">There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.</p><p class="p-16 block block_id_16 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="16">Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!</p><p class="p-17 block block_id_17 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="17">Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway; “and even if my head would go through,” thought poor Alice, “it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.” For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.</p><p class="p-18 block block_id_18 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="18">There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (“which certainly was not here before,” said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words “DRINK ME,” beautifully printed on it in large letters.</p><p class="p-19 block block_id_19 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="19">It was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little Alice was not going to do&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;in a hurry. “No, I’ll look first,” she said, “and see whether it’s marked ‘<em>poison</em>’ or not”; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they&nbsp;<em>would</em>&nbsp;not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger&nbsp;<em>very</em>&nbsp;deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.</p><p class="p-20 block block_id_20 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="20">However, this bottle was&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;marked “poison,” so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.</p><div data-block-index="21" class="block block_id_21 body"><p class="p-21 block block_id_22 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="22">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p class="p-22 block block_id_23 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="23">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p class="p-23 block block_id_24 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="24">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p></div><p class="p-24 block block_id_25 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="25">“What a curious feeling!” said Alice; “I must be shutting up like a telescope.”</p><p class="p-25 block block_id_26 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="26">And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; “for it might end, you know,” said Alice to herself, “in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?” And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.</p><p class="p-26 block block_id_27 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="27">After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.</p><p class="p-27 block block_id_28 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="28">“Come, there’s no use in crying like that!” said Alice to herself, rather sharply; “I advise you to leave off this minute!” She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. “But it’s no use now,” thought poor Alice, “to pretend to be two people! Why, there’s hardly enough of me left to make&nbsp;<em>one</em>&nbsp;respectable person!”</p><p class="p-28 block block_id_29 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="29">Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words “EAT ME” were beautifully marked in currants. “Well, I’ll eat it,” said Alice, “and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I’ll get into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!”</p><p class="p-29 block block_id_30 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="30">She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, “Which way? Which way?”, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.</p><p class="p-30 block block_id_31 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="31">So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.</p><div data-block-index="32" class="block block_id_32 body"><p class="p-31 block block_id_33 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="33">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p class="p-32 block block_id_34 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="34">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p class="p-33 block block_id_35 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="35">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p></div><h2 class="h2-0 block block_id_36 header outline-level-2" data-block-index="36"><a id="chap02"></a>CHAPTER II.<br>The Pool of Tears</h2><p class="p-34 block block_id_37 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="37">“Curiouser and curiouser!” cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); “now I’m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!” (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off). “Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I’m sure&nbsp;<em>I</em>&nbsp;shan’t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;—but I must be kind to them,” thought Alice, “or perhaps they won’t walk the way I want to go! Let me see: I’ll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.”</p><p class="p-35 block block_id_38 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="38">And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. “They must go by the carrier,” she thought; “and how funny it’ll seem, sending presents to one’s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!</p><p class="p-36 block block_id_39 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="39"><em>     Alice’s Right Foot, Esq.,</em></p><p class="p-37 block block_id_40 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="40"><em>       Hearthrug,</em></p><p class="p-38 block block_id_41 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="41"><em>         near the Fender,</em></p><p class="p-39 block block_id_42 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="42"><em>           (with Alice’s love).</em></p><p class="p-40 block block_id_43 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="43">Oh dear, what nonsense I’m talking!”</p><p class="p-41 block block_id_44 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="44">Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.</p><p class="p-42 block block_id_45 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="45">Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.</p><p class="p-43 block block_id_46 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="46">“You ought to be ashamed of yourself,” said Alice, “a great girl like you,” (she might well say this), “to go on crying in this way! Stop this moment, I tell you!” But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.</p><p class="p-44 block block_id_47 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="47">After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, “Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won’t she be savage if I’ve kept her waiting!” Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, “If you please, sir—” The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.</p><p class="p-45 block block_id_48 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="48">Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: “Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder if I’ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little different. But if I’m not the same, the next question is, Who in the world am I? Ah,&nbsp;<em>that’s</em>&nbsp;the great puzzle!” And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.</p><p class="p-46 block block_id_49 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="49">“I’m sure I’m not Ada,” she said, “for her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn’t go in ringlets at all; and I’m sure I can’t be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a very little! Besides,&nbsp;<em>she’s</em>&nbsp;she, and&nbsp;<em>I’m</em>&nbsp;I, and—oh dear, how puzzling it all is! I’ll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is—oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn’t signify: let’s try Geography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and Rome—no,&nbsp;<em>that’s</em>&nbsp;all wrong, I’m certain! I must have been changed for Mabel! I’ll try and say ‘<em>How doth the little</em>—’” and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:—</p><p class="p-47 block block_id_50 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="50"><em>“How doth the little crocodile<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improve his shining tail,<br>And pour the waters of the Nile<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On every golden scale!</em></p><p class="p-48 block block_id_51 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="51"><em>“How cheerfully he seems to grin,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How neatly spread his claws,<br>And welcome little fishes in<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With gently smiling jaws!”</em></p><p class="p-49 block block_id_52 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="52"></p><p class="p-50 block block_id_53 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="53">“I’m sure those are not the right words,” said poor Alice, and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, “I must be Mabel after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I’ve made up my mind about it; if I’m Mabel, I’ll stay down here! It’ll be no use their putting their heads down and saying ‘Come up again, dear!’ I shall only look up and say ‘Who am I then? Tell me that first, and then, if I like being that person, I’ll come up: if not, I’ll stay down here till I’m somebody else’—but, oh dear!” cried Alice, with a sudden burst of tears, “I do wish they&nbsp;<em>would</em>&nbsp;put their heads down! I am so&nbsp;<em>very</em>&nbsp;tired of being all alone here!”</p><p class="p-51 block block_id_54 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="54">As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit’s little white kid gloves while she was talking. “How&nbsp;<em>can</em>&nbsp;I have done that?” she thought. “I must be growing small again.” She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.</p><p class="p-52 block block_id_55 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="55">“That&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;a narrow escape!” said Alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; “and now for the garden!” and she ran with all speed back to the little door: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before, “and things are worse than ever,” thought the poor child, “for I never was so small as this before, never! And I declare it’s too bad, that it is!”</p><p class="p-53 block block_id_56 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="56">As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, “and in that case I can go back by railway,” she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high.</p><p class="p-54 block block_id_57 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="57">“I wish I hadn’t cried so much!” said Alice, as she swam about, trying to find her way out. “I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears! That&nbsp;<em>will</em>&nbsp;be a queer thing, to be sure! However, everything is queer to-day.”</p><p class="p-55 block block_id_58 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="58">Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.</p><p class="p-56 block block_id_59 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="59">“Would it be of any use, now,” thought Alice, “to speak to this mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there’s no harm in trying.” So she began: “O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!” (Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having seen in her brother’s Latin Grammar, “A mouse—of a mouse—to a mouse—a mouse—O mouse!”) The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing.</p><p class="p-57 block block_id_60 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="60">“Perhaps it doesn’t understand English,” thought Alice; “I daresay it’s a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.” (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.) So she began again: “Où est ma chatte?” which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright. “Oh, I beg your pardon!” cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal’s feelings. “I quite forgot you didn’t like cats.”</p><p class="p-58 block block_id_61 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="61">“Not like cats!” cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. “Would&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;like cats if you were me?”</p><p class="p-59 block block_id_62 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="62">“Well, perhaps not,” said Alice in a soothing tone: “don’t be angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you’d take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet thing,” Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the pool, “and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face—and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse—and she’s such a capital one for catching mice—oh, I beg your pardon!” cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt certain it must be really offended. “We won’t talk about her any more if you’d rather not.”</p><p class="p-60 block block_id_63 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="63">“We indeed!” cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his tail. “As if&nbsp;<em>I</em>&nbsp;would talk on such a subject! Our family always&nbsp;<em>hated</em>&nbsp;cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don’t let me hear the name again!”</p><p class="p-61 block block_id_64 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="64">“I won’t indeed!” said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation. “Are you—are you fond—of—of dogs?” The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly: “There is such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it’ll fetch things when you throw them, and it’ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things—I can’t remember half of them—and it belongs to a farmer, you know, and he says it’s so useful, it’s worth a hundred pounds! He says it kills all the rats and—oh dear!” cried Alice in a sorrowful tone, “I’m afraid I’ve offended it again!” For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.</p><p class="p-62 block block_id_65 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="65">So she called softly after it, “Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we won’t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don’t like them!” When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, “Let us get to the shore, and then I’ll tell you my history, and you’ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.”</p><p class="p-63 block block_id_66 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="66">It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.</p><h2 class="h2-1 block block_id_67 header outline-level-2" data-block-index="67"><a id="chap03"></a>CHAPTER III.<br>A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale</h2><p class="p-64 block block_id_68 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="68">They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank—the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.</p><p class="p-65 block block_id_69 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="69">The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, “I am older than you, and must know better;” and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no more to be said.</p><p class="p-66 block block_id_70 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="70">At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them, called out, “Sit down, all of you, and listen to me!&nbsp;<em>I’ll</em>&nbsp;soon make you dry enough!” They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.</p><p class="p-67 block block_id_71 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="71">“Ahem!” said the Mouse with an important air, “are you all ready? This is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! ‘William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria—’”</p><p class="p-68 block block_id_72 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="72">“Ugh!” said the Lory, with a shiver.</p><p class="p-69 block block_id_73 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="73">“I beg your pardon!” said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: “Did you speak?”</p><p class="p-70 block block_id_74 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="74">“Not I!” said the Lory hastily.</p><p class="p-71 block block_id_75 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="75">“I thought you did,” said the Mouse. “—I proceed. ‘Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable—’”</p><p class="p-72 block block_id_76 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="76">“Found&nbsp;<em>what</em>?” said the Duck.</p><p class="p-73 block block_id_77 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="77">“Found&nbsp;<em>it</em>,” the Mouse replied rather crossly: “of course you know what ‘it’ means.”</p><p class="p-74 block block_id_78 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="78">“I know what ‘it’ means well enough, when&nbsp;<em>I</em>&nbsp;find a thing,” said the Duck: “it’s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the archbishop find?”</p><p class="p-75 block block_id_79 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="79">The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, “‘—found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown. William’s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence of his Normans—’ How are you getting on now, my dear?” it continued, turning to Alice as it spoke.</p><p class="p-76 block block_id_80 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="80">“As wet as ever,” said Alice in a melancholy tone: “it doesn’t seem to dry me at all.”</p><p class="p-77 block block_id_81 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="81">“In that case,” said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, “I move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies—”</p><p class="p-78 block block_id_82 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="82">“Speak English!” said the Eaglet. “I don’t know the meaning of half those long words, and, what’s more, I don’t believe you do either!” And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds tittered audibly.</p><p class="p-79 block block_id_83 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="83">“What I was going to say,” said the Dodo in an offended tone, “was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.”</p><p class="p-80 block block_id_84 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="84">“What&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;a Caucus-race?” said Alice; not that she wanted much to know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that&nbsp;<em>somebody</em>&nbsp;ought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.</p><p class="p-81 block block_id_85 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="85">“Why,” said the Dodo, “the best way to explain it is to do it.” (And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.)</p><p class="p-82 block block_id_86 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="86">First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (“the exact shape doesn’t matter,” it said,) and then all the party were placed along the course, here and there. There was no “One, two, three, and away,” but they began running when they liked, and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However, when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called out “The race is over!” and they all crowded round it, panting, and asking, “But who has won?”</p><p class="p-83 block block_id_87 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="87">This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo said, “<em>Everybody</em>&nbsp;has won, and all must have prizes.”</p><p class="p-84 block block_id_88 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="88">“But who is to give the prizes?” quite a chorus of voices asked.</p><p class="p-85 block block_id_89 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="89">“Why,&nbsp;<em>she</em>, of course,” said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused way, “Prizes! Prizes!”</p><p class="p-86 block block_id_90 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="90">Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly one a-piece, all round.</p><p class="p-87 block block_id_91 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="91">“But she must have a prize herself, you know,” said the Mouse.</p><p class="p-88 block block_id_92 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="92">“Of course,” the Dodo replied very gravely. “What else have you got in your pocket?” he went on, turning to Alice.</p><p class="p-89 block block_id_93 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="93">“Only a thimble,” said Alice sadly.</p><p class="p-90 block block_id_94 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="94">“Hand it over here,” said the Dodo.</p><p class="p-91 block block_id_95 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="95">Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly presented the thimble, saying “We beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble;” and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered.</p><p class="p-92 block block_id_96 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="96">Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she could.</p><p class="p-93 block block_id_97 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="97">The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back. However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.</p><p class="p-94 block block_id_98 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="98">“You promised to tell me your history, you know,” said Alice, “and why it is you hate—C and D,” she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would be offended again.</p><p class="p-95 block block_id_99 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="99">“Mine is a long and a sad tale!” said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and sighing.</p><p class="p-96 block block_id_100 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="100">“It&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;a long tail, certainly,” said Alice, looking down with wonder at the Mouse’s tail; “but why do you call it sad?” And she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was something like this:—</p><p class="p-97 block block_id_101 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="101"><em>         “Fury said to a</em></p><p class="p-98 block block_id_102 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="102"><em>         mouse, That he</em></p><p class="p-99 block block_id_103 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="103"><em>        met in the</em></p><p class="p-100 block block_id_104 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="104"><em>       house,</em></p><p class="p-101 block block_id_105 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="105"><em>     ‘Let us</em></p><p class="p-102 block block_id_106 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="106"><em>      both go to</em></p><p class="p-103 block block_id_107 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="107"><em>       law: I will</em></p><p class="p-104 block block_id_108 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="108"><em>        prosecute</em></p><p class="p-105 block block_id_109 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="109"><em>         you.—Come,</em></p><p class="p-106 block block_id_110 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="110"><em>           I’ll take no</em></p><p class="p-107 block block_id_111 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="111"><em>           denial;

and the others all joined in chorus, “Yes, please do!” but the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.</p><p class="p-149 block block_id_153 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="153">“What a pity it wouldn’t stay!” sighed the Lory, as soon as it was quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter “Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose&nbsp;<em>your</em>&nbsp;temper!” “Hold your tongue, Ma!” said the young Crab, a little snappishly. “You’re enough to try the patience of an oyster!”</p><p class="p-150 block block_id_154 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="154">“I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!” said Alice aloud, addressing nobody in particular. “She’d soon fetch it back!”</p><p class="p-151 block block_id_155 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="155">“And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?” said the Lory.</p><p class="p-152 block block_id_156 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="156">Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet: “Dinah’s our cat. And she’s such a capital one for catching mice you can’t think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why, she’ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!”</p><p class="p-153 block block_id_157 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="157">This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, “I really must be getting home; the night-air doesn’t suit my throat!” and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to its children, “Come away, my dears! It’s high time you were all in bed!” On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.</p><p class="p-154 block block_id_158 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="158">“I wish I hadn’t mentioned Dinah!” she said to herself in a melancholy tone. “Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I’m sure she’s the best cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you any more!” And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to finish his story.</p><p class="p-155 block block_id_159 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="159"><a id="chap04"></a>CHAPTER IV.<br>The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill</p><p class="p-156 block block_id_160 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="160">It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard it muttering to itself “The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She’ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where&nbsp;<em>can</em>&nbsp;I have dropped them, I wonder?” Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to be seen—everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished completely.</p><p class="p-157 block block_id_161 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="161">Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and called out to her in an angry tone, “Why, Mary Ann, what&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;you doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick, now!” And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it had made.</p><p class="p-158 block block_id_162 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="162">“He took me for his housemaid,” she said to herself as she ran. “How surprised he’ll be when he finds out who I am! But I’d better take him his fan and gloves—that is, if I can find them.” As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name “W. RABBIT,” engraved upon it. She went in without knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves.</p><p class="p-159 block block_id_163 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="163">“How queer it seems,” Alice said to herself, “to be going messages for a rabbit! I suppose Dinah’ll be sending me on messages next!” And she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: “‘Miss Alice! Come here directly, and get ready for your walk!’ ‘Coming in a minute, nurse! But I’ve got to see that the mouse doesn’t get out.’ Only I don’t think,” Alice went on, “that they’d let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that!”</p><p class="p-160 block block_id_164 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="164">By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label this time with the words “DRINK ME,” but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips. “I know&nbsp;<em>something</em>&nbsp;interesting is sure to happen,” she said to herself, “whenever I eat or drink anything; so I’ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it’ll make me grow large again, for really I’m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!”</p><p class="p-161 block block_id_165 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="165">It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself “That’s quite enough—I hope I shan’t grow any more—As it is, I can’t get out at the door—I do wish I hadn’t drunk quite so much!”</p><p class="p-162 block block_id_166 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="166">Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head. Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself “Now I can do no more, whatever happens. What&nbsp;<em>will</em>&nbsp;become of me?”</p><p class="p-163 block block_id_167 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="167">Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect, and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.</p><p class="p-164 block block_id_168 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="168">“It was much pleasanter at home,” thought poor Alice, “when one wasn’t always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and rabbits. I almost wish I hadn’t gone down that rabbit-hole—and yet—and yet—it’s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what&nbsp;<em>can</em>&nbsp;have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when I grow up, I’ll write one—but I’m grown up now,” she added in a sorrowful tone; “at least there’s no room to grow up any more&nbsp;<em>here</em>.”</p><p class="p-165 block block_id_169 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="169">“But then,” thought Alice, “shall I&nbsp;<em>never</em>&nbsp;get any older than I am now? That’ll be a comfort, one way—never to be an old woman—but then—always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn’t like&nbsp;<em>that!</em>”</p><p class="p-166 block block_id_170 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="170">“Oh, you foolish Alice!” she answered herself. “How can you learn lessons in here? Why, there’s hardly room for&nbsp;<em>you</em>, and no room at all for any lesson-books!”</p><p class="p-167 block block_id_171 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="171">And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.</p><p class="p-168 block block_id_172 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="172">“Mary Ann! Mary Ann!” said the voice. “Fetch me my gloves this moment!” Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.</p><p class="p-169 block block_id_173 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="173">Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as the door opened inwards, and Alice’s elbow was pressed hard against it, that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself “Then I’ll go round and get in at the window.”</p><p class="p-170 block block_id_174 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="174">“<em>That</em>&nbsp;you won’t!” thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.</p><p class="p-171 block block_id_175 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="175">Next came an angry voice—the Rabbit’s—“Pat! Pat! Where are you?” And then a voice she had never heard before, “Sure then I’m here! Digging for apples, yer honour!”</p><p class="p-172 block block_id_176 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="176">“Digging for apples, indeed!” said the Rabbit angrily. “Here! Come and help me out of&nbsp;<em>this!</em>” (Sounds of more broken glass.)</p><p class="p-173 block block_id_177 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="177">“Now tell me, Pat, what’s that in the window?”</p><p class="p-174 block block_id_178 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="178">“Sure, it’s an arm, yer honour!” (He pronounced it “arrum.”)</p><p class="p-175 block block_id_179 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="179">“An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole window!”</p><p class="p-176 block block_id_180 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="180">“Sure, it does, yer honour: but it’s an arm for all that.”</p><p class="p-177 block block_id_181 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="181">“Well, it’s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!”</p><p class="p-178 block block_id_182 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="182">There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers now and then; such as, “Sure, I don’t like it, yer honour, at all, at all!” “Do as I tell you, you coward!” and at last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were&nbsp;<em>two</em>&nbsp;little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. “What a number of cucumber-frames there must be!” thought Alice. “I wonder what they’ll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they&nbsp;<em>could!</em>&nbsp;I’m sure&nbsp;<em>I</em>&nbsp;don’t want to stay in here any longer!”</p><p class="p-179 block block_id_183 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="183">She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all talking together: she made out the words: “Where’s the other ladder?—Why, I hadn’t to bring but one; Bill’s got the other—Bill! fetch it here, lad!—Here, put ’em up at this corner—No, tie ’em together first—they don’t reach half high enough yet—Oh! they’ll do well enough; don’t be particular—Here, Bill! catch hold of this rope—Will the roof bear?—Mind that loose slate—Oh, it’s coming down! Heads below!” (a loud crash)—“Now, who did that?—It was Bill, I fancy—Who’s to go down the chimney?—Nay,&nbsp;<em>I</em>&nbsp;shan’t!&nbsp;<em>You</em>&nbsp;do it!—<em>That</em>&nbsp;I won’t, then!—Bill’s to go down—Here, Bill! the master says you’re to go down the chimney!”</p><p class="p-180 block block_id_184 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="184">“Oh! So Bill’s got to come down the chimney, has he?” said Alice to herself. “Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn’t be in Bill’s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but I&nbsp;<em>think</em>&nbsp;I can kick a little!”</p><p class="p-181 block block_id_185 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="185">She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till she heard a little animal (she couldn’t guess of what sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then, saying to herself “This is Bill,” she gave one sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next.</p><p class="p-182 block block_id_186 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="186">The first thing she heard was a general chorus of “There goes Bill!” then the Rabbit’s voice along—“Catch him, you by the hedge!” then silence, and then another confusion of voices—“Hold up his head—Brandy now—Don’t choke him—How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell us all about it!”</p><p class="p-183 block block_id_187 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="187">Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (“That’s Bill,” thought Alice,) “Well, I hardly know—No more, thank ye; I’m better now—but I’m a deal too flustered to tell you—all I know is, something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!”</p><p class="p-184 block block_id_188 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="188">“So you did, old fellow!” said the others.</p><p class="p-185 block block_id_189 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="189">“We must burn the house down!” said the Rabbit’s voice; and Alice called out as loud as she could, “If you do, I’ll set Dinah at you!”</p><p class="p-186 block block_id_190 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="190">There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, “I wonder what they&nbsp;<em>will</em>&nbsp;do next! If they had any sense, they’d take the roof off.” After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, “A barrowful will do, to begin with.”</p><p class="p-187 block block_id_191 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="191">“A barrowful of&nbsp;<em>what?</em>” thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face. “I’ll put a stop to this,” she said to herself, and shouted out, “You’d better not do that again!” which produced another dead silence.</p><p class="p-188 block block_id_192 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="192">Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her head. “If I eat one of these cakes,” she thought, “it’s sure to make&nbsp;<em>some</em>&nbsp;change in my size; and as it can’t possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I suppose.”</p><p class="p-189 block block_id_193 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="193">So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a thick wood.</p><p class="p-190 block block_id_194 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="194">“The first thing I’ve got to do,” said Alice to herself, as she wandered about in the wood, “is to grow to my right size again; and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be the best plan.”</p><p class="p-191 block block_id_195 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="195">It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry.</p><p class="p-192 block block_id_196 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="196">An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. “Poor little thing!” said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.</p><p class="p-193 block block_id_197 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="197">Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.</p><p class="p-194 block block_id_198 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="198">This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and till the puppy’s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.</p><p class="p-195 block block_id_199 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="199">“And yet what a dear little puppy it was!” said Alice, as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the leaves: “I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if—if I’d only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I’d nearly forgotten that I’ve got to grow up again! Let me see—how&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;it to be managed? I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great question is, what?”</p><p class="p-196 block block_id_200 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="200">The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.</p><p class="p-197 block block_id_201 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="201">She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else.</p><p class="p-198 block block_id_202 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="202"><a id="chap05"></a>CHAPTER V.<br>Advice from a Caterpillar</p><p class="p-199 block block_id_203 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="203">The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.</p><p class="p-200 block block_id_204 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="204">“Who are&nbsp;<em>you?</em>” said the Caterpillar.</p><p class="p-201 block block_id_205 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="205">This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly, “I—I hardly know, sir, just at present—at least I know who I&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.”</p><p class="p-202 block block_id_206 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="206">“What do you mean by that?” said the Caterpillar sternly. “Explain yourself!”</p><p class="p-203 block block_id_207 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="207">“I can’t explain&nbsp;<em>myself</em>, I’m afraid, sir,” said Alice, “because I’m not myself, you see.”</p><p class="p-204 block block_id_208 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="208">“I don’t see,” said the Caterpillar.</p><p class="p-205 block block_id_209 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="209">“I’m afraid I can’t put it more clearly,” Alice replied very politely, “for I can’t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.”</p><p class="p-206 block block_id_210 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="210">“It isn’t,” said the Caterpillar.</p><p class="p-207 block block_id_211 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="211">“Well, perhaps you haven’t found it so yet,” said Alice; “but when you have to turn into a chrysalis—you will some day, you know—and then after that into a butterfly, I should think you’ll feel it a little queer, won’t you?”</p><p class="p-208 block block_id_212 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="212">“Not a bit,” said the Caterpillar.</p><p class="p-209 block block_id_213 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="213">“Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,” said Alice; “all I know is, it would feel very queer to&nbsp;<em>me</em>.”</p><p class="p-210 block block_id_214 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="214">“You!” said the Caterpillar contemptuously. “Who are&nbsp;<em>you?</em>”</p><p class="p-211 block block_id_215 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="215">Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation. Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar’s making such&nbsp;<em>very</em>&nbsp;short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, “I think, you ought to tell me who&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;are, first.”</p><p class="p-212 block block_id_216 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="216">“Why?” said the Caterpillar.</p><p class="p-213 block block_id_217 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="217">Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a&nbsp;<em>very</em>&nbsp;unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.</p><p class="p-214 block block_id_218 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="218">“Come back!” the Caterpillar called after her. “I’ve something important to say!”</p><p class="p-215 block block_id_219 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="219">This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.</p><p class="p-216 block block_id_220 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="220">“Keep your temper,” said the Caterpillar.</p><p class="p-217 block block_id_221 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="221">“Is that all?” said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she could.</p><p class="p-218 block block_id_222 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="222">“No,” said the Caterpillar.</p><p class="p-219 block block_id_223 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="223">Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, “So you think you’re changed, do you?”</p><p class="p-220 block block_id_224 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="224">“I’m afraid I am, sir,” said Alice; “I can’t remember things as I used—and I don’t keep the same size for ten minutes together!”</p><p class="p-221 block block_id_225 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="225">“Can’t remember&nbsp;<em>what</em>&nbsp;things?” said the Caterpillar.</p><p class="p-222 block block_id_226 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="226">“Well, I’ve tried to say “How doth the little busy bee,” but it all came different!” Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.</p><p class="p-223 block block_id_227 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="227">“Repeat, “<em>You are old, Father William</em>,’” said the Caterpillar.</p><p class="p-224 block block_id_228 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="228">Alice folded her hands, and began:—</p><p class="p-225 block block_id_229 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="229"><em>“You are old, Father William,” the young man said,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“And your hair has become very white;<br>And yet you incessantly stand on your head—<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think, at your age, it is right?”</em></p><p class="p-226 block block_id_230 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="230"><em>“In my youth,” Father William replied to his son,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I feared it might injure the brain;<br>But, now that I’m perfectly sure I have none,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, I do it again and again.”</em></p><p class="p-227 block block_id_231 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="231"><em>“You are old,” said the youth, “as I mentioned before,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And have grown most uncommonly fat;<br>Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door—<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pray, what is the reason of that?”</em></p><p class="p-228 block block_id_232 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="232"><em>“In my youth,” said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I kept all my limbs very supple<br>By the use of this ointment—one shilling the box—<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to sell you a couple?”</em></p><p class="p-229 block block_id_233 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="233"><em>“You are old,” said the youth, “and your jaws are too weak<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For anything tougher than suet;<br>Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak—<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pray, how did you manage to do it?”</em></p><p class="p-230 block block_id_234 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="234"><em>“In my youth,” said his father, “I took to the law,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And argued each case with my wife;<br>And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has lasted the rest of my life.”</em></p><p class="p-231 block block_id_235 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="235"><em>“You are old,” said the youth, “one would hardly suppose<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That your eye was as steady as ever;<br>Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose—<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What made you so awfully clever?”</em></p><p class="p-232 block block_id_236 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="236"><em>“I have answered three questions, and that is enough,”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said his father;

“only one doesn’t like changing so often, you know.”</p><p class="p-240 block block_id_244 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="244">“I&nbsp;<em>don’t</em>&nbsp;know,” said the Caterpillar.</p><p class="p-241 block block_id_245 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="245">Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.</p><p class="p-242 block block_id_246 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="246">“Are you content now?” said the Caterpillar.</p><p class="p-243 block block_id_247 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="247">“Well, I should like to be a&nbsp;<em>little</em>&nbsp;larger, sir, if you wouldn’t mind,” said Alice: “three inches is such a wretched height to be.”</p><p class="p-244 block block_id_248 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="248">“It is a very good height indeed!” said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).</p><p class="p-245 block block_id_249 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="249">“But I’m not used to it!” pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she thought of herself, “I wish the creatures wouldn’t be so easily offended!”</p><p class="p-246 block block_id_250 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="250">“You’ll get used to it in time,” said the Caterpillar; and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.</p><p class="p-247 block block_id_251 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="251">This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went, “One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter.”</p><p class="p-248 block block_id_252 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="252">“One side of&nbsp;<em>what?</em>&nbsp;The other side of&nbsp;<em>what?</em>” thought Alice to herself.</p><p class="p-249 block block_id_253 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="253">“Of the mushroom,” said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.</p><p class="p-250 block block_id_254 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="254">Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.</p><p class="p-251 block block_id_255 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="255">“And now which is which?” she said to herself, and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!</p><p class="p-252 block block_id_256 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="256">She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit.</p><div data-block-index="257" class="block block_id_257 body"><p class="p-253 block block_id_258 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="258">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p class="p-254 block block_id_259 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="259">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p class="p-255 block block_id_260 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="260">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p></div><p class="p-256 block block_id_261 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="261">“Come, my head’s free at last!” said Alice in a tone of delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her.</p><p class="p-257 block block_id_262 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="262">“What&nbsp;<em>can</em>&nbsp;all that green stuff be?” said Alice. “And where&nbsp;<em>have</em>&nbsp;my shoulders got to?

She had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating her violently with its wings.</p><p class="p-259 block block_id_264 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="264">“Serpent!” screamed the Pigeon.</p><p class="p-260 block block_id_265 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="265">“I’m&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;a serpent!” said Alice indignantly. “Let me alone!”</p><p class="p-261 block block_id_266 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="266">“Serpent, I say again!” repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, “I’ve tried every way, and nothing seems to suit them!”</p><p class="p-262 block block_id_267 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="267">“I haven’t the least idea what you’re talking about,” said Alice.</p><p class="p-263 block block_id_268 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="268">“I’ve tried the roots of trees, and I’ve tried banks, and I’ve tried hedges,” the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; “but those serpents! There’s no pleasing them!”</p><p class="p-264 block block_id_269 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="269">Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.</p><p class="p-265 block block_id_270 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="270">“As if it wasn’t trouble enough hatching the eggs,” said the Pigeon; “but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I haven’t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!”</p><p class="p-266 block block_id_271 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="271">“I’m very sorry you’ve been annoyed,” said Alice, who was beginning to see its meaning.</p><p class="p-267 block block_id_272 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="272">“And just as I’d taken the highest tree in the wood,” continued the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, “and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!”</p><p class="p-268 block block_id_273 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="273">“But I’m&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;a serpent, I tell you!” said Alice. “I’m a—I’m a—”</p><p class="p-269 block block_id_274 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="274">“Well!&nbsp;<em>What</em>&nbsp;are you?” said the Pigeon. “I can see you’re trying to invent something!”</p><p class="p-270 block block_id_275 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="275">“I—I’m a little girl,” said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.</p><p class="p-271 block block_id_276 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="276">“A likely story indeed!” said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt. “I’ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never&nbsp;<em>one</em>&nbsp;with such a neck as that! No, no! You’re a serpent; and there’s no use denying it. I suppose you’ll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg!”</p><p class="p-272 block block_id_277 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="277">“I&nbsp;<em>have</em>&nbsp;tasted eggs, certainly,” said Alice, who was a very truthful child; “but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you know.”</p><p class="p-273 block block_id_278 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="278">“I don’t believe it,” said the Pigeon; “but if they do, why then they’re a kind of serpent, that’s all I can say.”</p><p class="p-274 block block_id_279 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="279">This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, “You’re looking for eggs, I know&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;well enough; and what does it matter to me whether you’re a little girl or a serpent?”</p><p class="p-275 block block_id_280 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="280">“It matters a good deal to&nbsp;<em>me</em>,” said Alice hastily; “but I’m not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn’t want&nbsp;<em>yours</em>: I don’t like them raw.”</p><p class="p-276 block block_id_281 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="281">“Well, be off, then!” said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.</p><p class="p-277 block block_id_282 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="282">It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual. “Come, there’s half my plan done now! How puzzling all these changes are! I’m never sure what I’m going to be, from one minute to another! However, I’ve got back to my right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden—how&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;that to be done, I wonder?” As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high. “Whoever lives there,” thought Alice, “it’ll never do to come upon them&nbsp;<em>this</em>&nbsp;size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!” So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.</p><p class="p-278 block block_id_283 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="283"><a id="chap06"></a>CHAPTER VI.<br>Pig and Pepper</p><p class="p-279 block block_id_284 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="284">For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood—(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery: otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a fish)—and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.</p><p class="p-280 block block_id_285 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="285">The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other, saying, in a solemn tone, “For the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen to play croquet.” The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the words a little, “From the Queen. An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.”</p><p class="p-281 block block_id_286 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="286">Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.</p><p class="p-282 block block_id_287 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="287">Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.</p><p class="p-283 block block_id_288 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="288">Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.</p><p class="p-284 block block_id_289 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="289">“There’s no sort of use in knocking,” said the Footman, “and that for two reasons. First, because I’m on the same side of the door as you are; secondly, because they’re making such a noise inside, no one could possibly hear you.” And certainly there&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;a most extraordinary noise going on within—a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.</p><p class="p-285 block block_id_290 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="290">“Please, then,” said Alice, “how am I to get in?”</p><p class="p-286 block block_id_291 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="291">“There might be some sense in your knocking,” the Footman went on without attending to her, “if we had the door between us. For instance, if you were&nbsp;<em>inside</em>, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know.” He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. “But perhaps he can’t help it,” she said to herself; “his eyes are so&nbsp;<em>very</em>&nbsp;nearly at the top of his head. But at any rate he might answer questions.—How am I to get in?” she repeated, aloud.</p><p class="p-287 block block_id_292 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="292">“I shall sit here,” the Footman remarked, “till tomorrow—”</p><p class="p-288 block block_id_293 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="293">At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came skimming out, straight at the Footman’s head: it just grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.</p><p class="p-289 block block_id_294 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="294">“—or next day, maybe,” the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly as if nothing had happened.</p><p class="p-290 block block_id_295 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="295">“How am I to get in?” asked Alice again, in a louder tone.</p><p class="p-291 block block_id_296 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="296">“<em>Are</em>&nbsp;you to get in at all?” said the Footman. “That’s the first question, you know.”</p><p class="p-292 block block_id_297 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="297">It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. “It’s really dreadful,” she muttered to herself, “the way all the creatures argue. It’s enough to drive one crazy!”</p><p class="p-293 block block_id_298 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="298">The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark, with variations. “I shall sit here,” he said, “on and off, for days and days.”</p><p class="p-294 block block_id_299 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="299">“But what am&nbsp;<em>I</em>&nbsp;to do?” said Alice.</p><p class="p-295 block block_id_300 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="300">“Anything you like,” said the Footman, and began whistling.</p><p class="p-296 block block_id_301 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="301">“Oh, there’s no use in talking to him,” said Alice desperately: “he’s perfectly idiotic!” And she opened the door and went in.</p><p class="p-297 block block_id_302 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="302">The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.</p><p class="p-298 block block_id_303 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="303">“There’s certainly too much pepper in that soup!” Alice said to herself, as well as she could for sneezing.</p><p class="p-299 block block_id_304 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="304">There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment’s pause. The only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.</p><p class="p-300 block block_id_305 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="305">“Please would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, “why your cat grins like that?”</p><p class="p-301 block block_id_306 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="306">“It’s a Cheshire cat,” said the Duchess, “and that’s why. Pig!”</p><p class="p-302 block block_id_307 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="307">She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:—</p><p class="p-303 block block_id_308 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="308">“I didn’t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn’t know that cats&nbsp;<em>could</em>&nbsp;grin.”</p><p class="p-304 block block_id_309 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="309">“They all can,” said the Duchess; “and most of ’em do.”</p><p class="p-305 block block_id_310 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="310">“I don’t know of any that do,” Alice said very politely, feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation.</p><p class="p-306 block block_id_311 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="311">“You don’t know much,” said the Duchess; “and that’s a fact.”</p><p class="p-307 block block_id_312 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="312">Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby—the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already, that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.</p><p class="p-308 block block_id_313 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="313">“Oh,&nbsp;<em>please</em>&nbsp;mind what you’re doing!” cried Alice, jumping up and down in an agony of terror. “Oh, there goes his&nbsp;<em>precious</em>&nbsp;nose!” as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off.</p><p class="p-309 block block_id_314 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="314">“If everybody minded their own business,” the Duchess said in a hoarse growl, “the world would go round a deal faster than it does.”</p><p class="p-310 block block_id_315 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="315">“Which would&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;be an advantage,” said Alice, who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. “Just think of what work it would make with the day and night! You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis—”</p><p class="p-311 block block_id_316 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="316">“Talking of axes,” said the Duchess, “chop off her head!”</p><p class="p-312 block block_id_317 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="317">Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to be listening, so she went on again: “Twenty-four hours, I&nbsp;<em>think</em>; or is it twelve? I—”</p><p class="p-313 block block_id_318 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="318">“Oh, don’t bother&nbsp;<em>me</em>,” said the Duchess; “I never could abide figures!” And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line:</p><p class="p-314 block block_id_319 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="319"><em>“Speak roughly to your little boy,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And beat him when he sneezes:<br>He only does it to annoy,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he knows it teases.”</em></p><p class="p-315 block block_id_320 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="320">CHORUS.<br>(In which the cook and the baby joined):</p><p class="p-316 block block_id_321 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="321"><em>“Wow! wow! wow!”</em></p><p class="p-317 block block_id_322 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="322">While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so, that Alice could hardly hear the words:—</p><p class="p-318 block block_id_323 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="323"><em>“I speak severely to my boy,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beat him when he sneezes;<br>For he can thoroughly enjoy<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pepper when he pleases!”</em></p><p class="p-319 block block_id_324 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="324">CHORUS.</p><p class="p-320 block block_id_325 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="325"><em>“Wow! wow! wow!”</em></p><p class="p-321 block block_id_326 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="326">“Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!” the Duchess said to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke. “I must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen,” and she hurried out of the room. The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.</p><p class="p-322 block block_id_327 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="327">Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions, “just like a star-fish,” thought Alice. The poor little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.</p><p class="p-323 block block_id_328 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="328">As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open air. “If I don’t take this child away with me,” thought Alice, “they’re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn’t it be murder to leave it behind?” She said the last words out loud, and the little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time). “Don’t grunt,” said Alice; “that’s not at all a proper way of expressing yourself.”</p><p class="p-324 block block_id_329 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="329">The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had a&nbsp;<em>very</em>&nbsp;turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at all. “But perhaps it was only sobbing,” she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears.</p><p class="p-325 block block_id_330 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="330">No, there were no tears. “If you’re going to turn into a pig, my dear,” said Alice, seriously, “I’ll have nothing more to do with you. Mind now!” The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.</p><p class="p-326 block block_id_331 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="331">Alice was just beginning to think to herself, “Now, what am I to do with this creature when I get it home?” when it grunted again, so violently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time there could be&nbsp;<em>no</em>&nbsp;mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further.</p><p class="p-327 block block_id_332 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="332">So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood. “If it had grown up,” she said to herself, “it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes rather a handsome pig, I think.” And she began thinking over other children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying to herself, “if one only knew the right way to change them—” when she was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off.</p><p class="p-328 block block_id_333 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="333">The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she thought: still it had&nbsp;<em>very</em>&nbsp;long claws and a great many teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect.</p><p class="p-329 block block_id_334 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="334">“Cheshire Puss,” she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider. “Come, it’s pleased so far,” thought Alice, and she went on. “Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?”</p><p class="p-330 block block_id_335 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="335">“That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the Cat.</p><p class="p-331 block block_id_336 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="336">“I don’t much care where—” said Alice.</p><p class="p-332 block block_id_337 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="337">“Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,” said the Cat.</p><p class="p-333 block block_id_338 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="338">“—so long as I get&nbsp;<em>somewhere</em>,” Alice added as an explanation.</p><p class="p-334 block block_id_339 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="339">“Oh, you’re sure to do that,” said the Cat, “if you only walk long enough.”</p><p class="p-335 block block_id_340 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="340">Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question. “What sort of people live about here?”</p><p class="p-336 block block_id_341 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="341">“In&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;direction,” the Cat said, waving its right paw round, “lives a Hatter: and in&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;direction,” waving the other paw, “lives a March Hare. Visit either you like: they’re both mad.”</p><p class="p-337 block block_id_342 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="342">“But I don’t want to go among mad people,” Alice remarked.</p><p class="p-338 block block_id_343 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="343">“Oh, you can’t help that,” said the Cat: “we’re all mad here. I’m mad. You’re mad.”</p><p class="p-339 block block_id_344 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="344">“How do you know I’m mad?” said Alice.</p><p class="p-340 block block_id_345 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="345">“You must be,” said the Cat, “or you wouldn’t have come here.”</p><p class="p-341 block block_id_346 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="346">Alice didn’t think that proved it at all; however, she went on “And how do you know that you’re mad?”</p><p class="p-342 block block_id_347 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="347">“To begin with,” said the Cat, “a dog’s not mad. You grant that?”</p><p class="p-343 block block_id_348 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="348">“I suppose so,” said Alice.</p><p class="p-344 block block_id_349 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="349">“Well, then,” the Cat went on, “you see, a dog growls when it’s angry, and wags its tail when it’s pleased. Now&nbsp;<em>I</em>&nbsp;growl when I’m pleased, and wag my tail when I’m angry. Therefore I’m mad.”</p><p class="p-345 block block_id_350 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="350">“<em>I</em>&nbsp;call it purring, not growling,” said Alice.</p><p class="p-346 block block_id_351 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="351">“Call it what you like,” said the Cat. “Do you play croquet with the Queen to-day?”</p><p class="p-347 block block_id_352 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="352">“I should like it very much,” said Alice, “but I haven’t been invited yet.”</p><p class="p-348 block block_id_353 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="353">“You’ll see me there,” said the Cat, and vanished.</p><p class="p-349 block block_id_354 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="354">Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer things happening.

It was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself “Suppose it should be raving mad after all!

The Hatter’s remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. “I don’t quite understand you,” she said, as politely as she could.</p><p class="p-391 block block_id_396 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="396">“The Dormouse is asleep again,” said the Hatter, and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose.</p><p class="p-392 block block_id_397 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="397">The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its eyes, “Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.”</p><p class="p-393 block block_id_398 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="398">“Have you guessed the riddle yet?” the Hatter said, turning to Alice again.</p><p class="p-394 block block_id_399 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="399">“No, I give it up,” Alice replied: “what’s the answer?”</p><p class="p-395 block block_id_400 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="400">“I haven’t the slightest idea,” said the Hatter.</p><p class="p-396 block block_id_401 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="401">“Nor I,” said the March Hare.</p><p class="p-397 block block_id_402 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="402">Alice sighed wearily. “I think you might do something better with the time,” she said, “than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.”</p><p class="p-398 block block_id_403 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="403">“If you knew Time as well as I do,” said the Hatter, “you wouldn’t talk about wasting&nbsp;<em>it</em>.

Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he’d do almost anything you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o’clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons: you’d only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one, time for dinner!”</p><p class="p-403 block block_id_408 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="408">(“I only wish it was,” the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)</p><p class="p-404 block block_id_409 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="409">“That would be grand, certainly,” said Alice thoughtfully: “but then—I shouldn’t be hungry for it, you know.”</p><p class="p-405 block block_id_410 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="410">“Not at first, perhaps,” said the Hatter: “but you could keep it to half-past one as long as you liked.”</p><p class="p-406 block block_id_411 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="411">“Is that the way&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;manage?” Alice asked.</p><p class="p-407 block block_id_412 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="412">The Hatter shook his head mournfully. “Not I!” he replied. “We quarrelled last March—just before&nbsp;<em>he</em>&nbsp;went mad, you know—” (pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) “—it was at the great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing</p><p class="p-408 block block_id_413 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="413">‘Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!<br>How I wonder what you’re at!’</p><p class="p-409 block block_id_414 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="414">You know the song, perhaps?”</p><p class="p-410 block block_id_415 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="415">“I’ve heard something like it,” said Alice.</p><p class="p-411 block block_id_416 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="416">“It goes on, you know,” the Hatter continued, “in this way:—</p><p class="p-412 block block_id_417 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="417">‘Up above the world you fly,<br>Like a tea-tray in the sky.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twinkle, twinkle—’”</p><p class="p-413 block block_id_418 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="418">Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep “<em>Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle</em>—” and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop.</p><p class="p-414 block block_id_419 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="419">“Well, I’d hardly finished the first verse,” said the Hatter, “when the Queen jumped up and bawled out, ‘He’s murdering the time!

However, he consented to go on. “And so these three little sisters—they were learning to draw, you know—”</p><p class="p-445 block block_id_450 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="450">“What did they draw?” said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.</p><p class="p-446 block block_id_451 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="451">“Treacle,” said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.</p><p class="p-447 block block_id_452 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="452">“I want a clean cup,” interrupted the Hatter: “let’s all move one place on.”</p><p class="p-448 block block_id_453 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="453">He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare moved into the Dormouse’s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.</p><p class="p-449 block block_id_454 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="454">Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very cautiously: “But I don’t understand. Where did they draw the treacle from?”</p><p class="p-450 block block_id_455 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="455">“You can draw water out of a water-well,” said the Hatter; “so I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well—eh, stupid?”</p><p class="p-451 block block_id_456 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="456">“But they were&nbsp;<em>in</em>&nbsp;the well,” Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing to notice this last remark.</p><p class="p-452 block block_id_457 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="457">“Of course they were,” said the Dormouse; “—well in.”</p><p class="p-453 block block_id_458 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="458">This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it.</p><p class="p-454 block block_id_459 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="459">“They were learning to draw,” the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; “and they drew all manner of things—everything that begins with an M—”</p><p class="p-455 block block_id_460 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="460">“Why with an M?” said Alice.</p><p class="p-456 block block_id_461 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="461">“Why not?” said the March Hare.</p><p class="p-457 block block_id_462 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="462">Alice was silent.</p><p class="p-458 block block_id_463 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="463">The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a little shriek, and went on: “—that begins with an M, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness—you know you say things are “much of a muchness”—did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?”</p><p class="p-459 block block_id_464 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="464">“Really, now you ask me,” said Alice, very much confused, “I don’t think—”</p><p class="p-460 block block_id_465 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="465">“Then you shouldn’t talk,” said the Hatter.</p><p class="p-461 block block_id_466 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="466">This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her: the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.</p><p class="p-462 block block_id_467 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="467">“At any rate I’ll never go&nbsp;<em>there</em>&nbsp;again!” said Alice as she picked her way through the wood. “It’s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all my life!”</p><p class="p-463 block block_id_468 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="468">Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it. “That’s very curious!” she thought. “But everything’s curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.” And in she went.</p><p class="p-464 block block_id_469 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="469">Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little glass table. “Now, I’ll manage better this time,” she said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that led into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high: then she walked down the little passage: and&nbsp;<em>then</em>—she found herself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains.</p><p class="p-465 block block_id_470 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="470"><a id="chap08"></a>CHAPTER VIII.<br>The Queen’s Croquet-Ground</p><p class="p-466 block block_id_471 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="471">A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say, “Look out now, Five! Don’t go splashing paint over me like that!”</p><p class="p-467 block block_id_472 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="472">“I couldn’t help it,” said Five, in a sulky tone; “Seven jogged my elbow.”</p><p class="p-468 block block_id_473 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="473">On which Seven looked up and said, “That’s right, Five! Always lay the blame on others!”</p><p class="p-469 block block_id_474 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="474">“<em>You’d</em>&nbsp;better not talk!” said Five. “I heard the Queen say only yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!”</p><p class="p-470 block block_id_475 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="475">“What for?” said the one who had spoken first.</p><p class="p-471 block block_id_476 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="476">“That’s none of&nbsp;<em>your</em>&nbsp;business, Two!” said Seven.</p><p class="p-472 block block_id_477 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="477">“Yes, it&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;his business!” said Five, “and I’ll tell him—it was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.”</p><p class="p-473 block block_id_478 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="478">Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun “Well, of all the unjust things—” when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also, and all of them bowed low.</p><p class="p-474 block block_id_479 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="479">“Would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, “why you are painting those roses?”</p><p class="p-475 block block_id_480 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="480">Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low voice, “Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a&nbsp;<em>red</em>&nbsp;rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So you see, Miss, we’re doing our best, afore she comes, to—” At this moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called out “The Queen! The Queen!” and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.</p><p class="p-476 block block_id_481 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="481">First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King’s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.</p><p class="p-477 block block_id_482 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="482">Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions; “and besides, what would be the use of a procession,” thought she, “if people had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn’t see it?” So she stood still where she was, and waited.</p><p class="p-478 block block_id_483 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="483">When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked at her, and the Queen said severely “Who is this?” She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.</p><p class="p-479 block block_id_484 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="484">“Idiot!” said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to Alice, she went on, “What’s your name, child?”</p><p class="p-480 block block_id_485 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="485">“My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,” said Alice very politely; but she added, to herself, “Why, they’re only a pack of cards, after all. I needn’t be afraid of them!”</p><p class="p-481 block block_id_486 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="486">“And who are&nbsp;<em>these?</em>” said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rose-tree; for, you see, as they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her own children.</p><p class="p-482 block block_id_487 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="487">“How should&nbsp;<em>I</em>&nbsp;know?” said Alice, surprised at her own courage. “It’s no business of&nbsp;<em>mine</em>.”</p><p class="p-483 block block_id_488 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="488">The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast, screamed “Off with her head! Off—”</p><p class="p-484 block block_id_489 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="489">“Nonsense!” said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was silent.</p><p class="p-485 block block_id_490 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="490">The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said “Consider, my dear: she is only a child!”</p><p class="p-486 block block_id_491 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="491">The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave “Turn them over!”</p><p class="p-487 block block_id_492 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="492">The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.</p><p class="p-488 block block_id_493 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="493">“Get up!” said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else.</p><p class="p-489 block block_id_494 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="494">“Leave off that!” screamed the Queen. “You make me giddy.” And then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, “What&nbsp;<em>have</em>&nbsp;you been doing here?”</p><p class="p-490 block block_id_495 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="495">“May it please your Majesty,” said Two, in a very humble tone, going down on one knee as he spoke, “we were trying—”</p><p class="p-491 block block_id_496 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="496">“<em>I</em>&nbsp;see!” said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses. “Off with their heads!” and the procession moved on, three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection.</p><p class="p-492 block block_id_497 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="497">“You shan’t be beheaded!” said Alice, and she put them into a large flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the others.</p><p class="p-493 block block_id_498 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="498">“Are their heads off?” shouted the Queen.</p><p class="p-494 block block_id_499 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="499">“Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!” the soldiers shouted in reply.</p><p class="p-495 block block_id_500 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="500">“That’s right!” shouted the Queen. “Can you play croquet?”</p><p class="p-496 block block_id_501 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="501">The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was evidently meant for her.</p><p class="p-497 block block_id_502 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="502">“Yes!” shouted Alice.</p><p class="p-498 block block_id_503 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="503">“Come on, then!” roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession, wondering very much what would happen next.</p><p class="p-499 block block_id_504 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="504">“It’s—it’s a very fine day!” said a timid voice at her side. She was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.</p><p class="p-500 block block_id_505 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="505">“Very,” said Alice: “—where’s the Duchess?”</p><p class="p-501 block block_id_506 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="506">“Hush! Hush!” said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered “She’s under sentence of execution.”</p><p class="p-502 block block_id_507 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="507">“What for?” said Alice.</p><p class="p-503 block block_id_508 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="508">“Did you say ‘What a pity!’?” the Rabbit asked.</p><p class="p-504 block block_id_509 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="509">“No, I didn’t,” said Alice: “I don’t think it’s at all a pity. I said ‘What for?’”</p><p class="p-505 block block_id_510 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="510">“She boxed the Queen’s ears—” the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little scream of laughter. “Oh, hush!” the Rabbit whispered in a frightened tone. “The Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the Queen said—”</p><p class="p-506 block block_id_511 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="511">“Get to your places!” shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.</p><p class="p-507 block block_id_512 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="512">The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo: she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it&nbsp;<em>would</em>&nbsp;twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.</p><p class="p-508 block block_id_513 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="513">The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and shouting “Off with his head!” or “Off with her head!” about once in a minute.</p><p class="p-509 block block_id_514 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="514">Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute, “and then,” thought she, “what would become of me? They’re dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there’s any one left alive!”</p><p class="p-510 block block_id_515 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="515">She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself “It’s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk to.”</p><p class="p-511 block block_id_516 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="516">“How are you getting on?” said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with.</p><p class="p-512 block block_id_517 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="517">Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. “It’s no use speaking to it,” she thought, “till its ears have come, or at least one of them.” In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.</p><p class="p-513 block block_id_518 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="518">“I don’t think they play at all fairly,” Alice began, in rather a complaining tone, “and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can’t hear oneself speak—and they don’t seem to have any rules in particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them—and you’ve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there’s the arch I’ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the ground—and I should have croqueted the Queen’s hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it saw mine coming!”</p><p class="p-514 block block_id_519 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="519">“How do you like the Queen?” said the Cat in a low voice.</p><p class="p-515 block block_id_520 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="520">“Not at all,” said Alice: “she’s so extremely—” Just then she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on, “—likely to win, that it’s hardly worth while finishing the game.”</p><p class="p-516 block block_id_521 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="521">The Queen smiled and passed on.</p><p class="p-517 block block_id_522 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="522">“Who&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;you talking to?” said the King, going up to Alice, and looking at the Cat’s head with great curiosity.</p><p class="p-518 block block_id_523 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="523">“It’s a friend of mine—a Cheshire Cat,” said Alice: “allow me to introduce it.”</p><p class="p-519 block block_id_524 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="524">“I don’t like the look of it at all,” said the King: “however, it may kiss my hand if it likes.”</p><p class="p-520 block block_id_525 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="525">“I’d rather not,” the Cat remarked.</p><p class="p-521 block block_id_526 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="526">“Don’t be impertinent,” said the King, “and don’t look at me like that!” He got behind Alice as he spoke.</p><p class="p-522 block block_id_527 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="527">“A cat may look at a king,” said Alice. “I’ve read that in some book, but I don’t remember where.”</p><p class="p-523 block block_id_528 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="528">“Well, it must be removed,” said the King very decidedly, and he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, “My dear! I wish you would have this cat removed!”</p><p class="p-524 block block_id_529 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="529">The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small. “Off with his head!” she said, without even looking round.</p><p class="p-525 block block_id_530 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="530">“I’ll fetch the executioner myself,” said the King eagerly, and he hurried off.</p><p class="p-526 block block_id_531 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="531">Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going on, as she heard the Queen’s voice in the distance, screaming with passion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.</p><p class="p-527 block block_id_532 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="532">The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.</p><p class="p-528 block block_id_533 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="533">By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: “but it doesn’t matter much,” thought Alice, “as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground.” So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her friend.</p><p class="p-529 block block_id_534 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="534">When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.</p><p class="p-530 block block_id_535 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="535">The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said.</p><p class="p-531 block block_id_536 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="536">The executioner’s argument was, that you couldn’t cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn’t going to begin at&nbsp;<em>his</em>&nbsp;time of life.</p><p class="p-532 block block_id_537 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="537">The King’s argument was, that anything that had a head could be beheaded, and that you weren’t to talk nonsense.</p><p class="p-533 block block_id_538 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="538">The Queen’s argument was, that if something wasn’t done about it in less than no time she’d have everybody executed, all round. (It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.)</p><p class="p-534 block block_id_539 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="539">Alice could think of nothing else to say but “It belongs to the Duchess: you’d better ask&nbsp;<em>her</em>&nbsp;about it.”</p><p class="p-535 block block_id_540 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="540">“She’s in prison,” the Queen said to the executioner: “fetch her here.” And the executioner went off like an arrow.</p><p class="p-536 block block_id_541 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="541">The Cat’s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.</p><p class="p-537 block block_id_542 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="542"><a id="chap09"></a>CHAPTER IX.<br>The Mock Turtle’s Story</p><p class="p-538 block block_id_543 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="543">“You can’t think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!” said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice’s, and they walked off together.</p><p class="p-539 block block_id_544 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="544">Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they met in the kitchen.</p><p class="p-540 block block_id_545 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="545">“When&nbsp;<em>I’m</em>&nbsp;a Duchess,” she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful tone though), “I won’t have any pepper in my kitchen&nbsp;<em>at all</em>. Soup does very well without—Maybe it’s always pepper that makes people hot-tempered,” she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule, “and vinegar that makes them sour—and camomile that makes them bitter—and—and barley-sugar and such things that make children sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew&nbsp;<em>that</em>: then they wouldn’t be so stingy about it, you know—”</p><p class="p-541 block block_id_546 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="546">She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. “You’re thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can’t tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in a bit.”</p><p class="p-542 block block_id_547 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="547">“Perhaps it hasn’t one,” Alice ventured to remark.</p><p class="p-543 block block_id_548 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="548">“Tut, tut, child!” said the Duchess. “Everything’s got a moral, if only you can find it.” And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice’s side as she spoke.</p><p class="p-544 block block_id_549 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="549">Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the Duchess was&nbsp;<em>very</em>&nbsp;ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alice’s shoulder, and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could.</p><p class="p-545 block block_id_550 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="550">“The game’s going on rather better now,” she said, by way of keeping up the conversation a little.</p><p class="p-546 block block_id_551 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="551">“’Tis so,” said the Duchess: “and the moral of that is—‘Oh, ’tis love, ’tis love, that makes the world go round!’”</p><p class="p-547 block block_id_552 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="552">“Somebody said,” Alice whispered, “that it’s done by everybody minding their own business!”</p><p class="p-548 block block_id_553 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="553">“Ah, well! It means much the same thing,” said the Duchess, digging her sharp little chin into Alice’s shoulder as she added, “and the moral of&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;is—‘Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of themselves.’”</p><p class="p-549 block block_id_554 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="554">“How fond she is of finding morals in things!” Alice thought to herself.</p><p class="p-550 block block_id_555 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="555">“I dare say you’re wondering why I don’t put my arm round your waist,” the Duchess said after a pause: “the reason is, that I’m doubtful about the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?”</p><p class="p-551 block block_id_556 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="556">“He might bite,” Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried.</p><p class="p-552 block block_id_557 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="557">“Very true,” said the Duchess: “flamingoes and mustard both bite. And the moral of that is—‘Birds of a feather flock together.’”</p><p class="p-553 block block_id_558 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="558">“Only mustard isn’t a bird,” Alice remarked.</p><p class="p-554 block block_id_559 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="559">“Right, as usual,” said the Duchess: “what a clear way you have of putting things!”</p><p class="p-555 block block_id_560 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="560">“It’s a mineral, I&nbsp;<em>think</em>,” said Alice.</p><p class="p-556 block block_id_561 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="561">“Of course it is,” said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to everything that Alice said; “there’s a large mustard-mine near here. And the moral of that is—‘The more there is of mine, the less there is of yours.’”</p><p class="p-557 block block_id_562 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="562">“Oh, I know!” exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last remark, “it’s a vegetable. It doesn’t look like one, but it is.”</p><p class="p-558 block block_id_563 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="563">“I quite agree with you,” said the Duchess; “and the moral of that is—‘Be what you would seem to be’—or if you’d like it put more simply—‘Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise.’”</p><p class="p-559 block block_id_564 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="564">“I think I should understand that better,” Alice said very politely, “if I had it written down: but I can’t quite follow it as you say it.”</p><p class="p-560 block block_id_565 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="565">“That’s nothing to what I could say if I chose,” the Duchess replied, in a pleased tone.</p><p class="p-561 block block_id_566 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="566">“Pray don’t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,” said Alice.</p><p class="p-562 block block_id_567 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="567">“Oh, don’t talk about trouble!” said the Duchess. “I make you a present of everything I’ve said as yet.”</p><p class="p-563 block block_id_568 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="568">“A cheap sort of present!” thought Alice. “I’m glad they don’t give birthday presents like that!” But she did not venture to say it out loud.</p><p class="p-564 block block_id_569 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="569">“Thinking again?” the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp little chin.</p><p class="p-565 block block_id_570 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="570">“I’ve a right to think,” said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to feel a little worried.</p><p class="p-566 block block_id_571 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="571">“Just about as much right,” said the Duchess, “as pigs have to fly; and the m—”</p><p class="p-567 block block_id_572 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="572">But here, to Alice’s great surprise, the Duchess’s voice died away, even in the middle of her favourite word ‘moral,’ and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm.</p><p class="p-568 block block_id_573 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="573">“A fine day, your Majesty!” the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.</p><p class="p-569 block block_id_574 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="574">“Now, I give you fair warning,” shouted the Queen, stamping on the ground as she spoke; “either you or your head must be off, and that in about half no time! Take your choice!”</p><p class="p-570 block block_id_575 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="575">The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.</p><p class="p-571 block block_id_576 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="576">“Let’s go on with the game,” the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the croquet-ground.</p><p class="p-572 block block_id_577 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="577">The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen’s absence, and were resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment’s delay would cost them their lives.</p><p class="p-573 block block_id_578 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="578">All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with the other players, and shouting “Off with his head!” or “Off with her head!” Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of execution.</p><p class="p-574 block block_id_579 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="579">Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, “Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?”</p><p class="p-575 block block_id_580 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="580">“No,” said Alice. “I don’t even know what a Mock Turtle is.”</p><p class="p-576 block block_id_581 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="581">“It’s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,” said the Queen.</p><p class="p-577 block block_id_582 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="582">“I never saw one, or heard of one,” said Alice.</p><p class="p-578 block block_id_583 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="583">“Come on, then,” said the Queen, “and he shall tell you his history,”</p><p class="p-579 block block_id_584 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="584">As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice, to the company generally, “You are all pardoned.” “Come,&nbsp;<em>that’s</em>&nbsp;a good thing!” she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered.</p><p class="p-580 block block_id_585 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="585">They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (If you don’t know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) “Up, lazy thing!” said the Queen, “and take this young lady to see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some executions I have ordered;” and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage Queen: so she waited.</p><p class="p-581 block block_id_586 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="586">The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till she was out of sight: then it chuckled. “What fun!” said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice.</p><p class="p-582 block block_id_587 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="587">“What&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;the fun?” said Alice.</p><p class="p-583 block block_id_588 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="588">“Why,&nbsp;<em>she</em>,” said the Gryphon. “It’s all her fancy, that: they never executes nobody, you know. Come on!”</p><p class="p-584 block block_id_589 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="589">“Everybody says ‘come on!’ here,” thought Alice, as she went slowly after it: “I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!”</p><p class="p-585 block block_id_590 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="590">They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She pitied him deeply. “What is his sorrow?” she asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, “It’s all his fancy, that: he hasn’t got no sorrow, you know. Come on!”</p><p class="p-586 block block_id_591 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="591">So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes full of tears, but said nothing.</p><p class="p-587 block block_id_592 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="592">“This here young lady,” said the Gryphon, “she wants for to know your history, she do.”</p><p class="p-588 block block_id_593 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="593">“I’ll tell it her,” said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: “sit down, both of you, and don’t speak a word till I’ve finished.”</p><p class="p-589 block block_id_594 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="594">So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to herself, “I don’t see how he can&nbsp;<em>ever</em>&nbsp;finish, if he doesn’t begin.” But she waited patiently.</p><p class="p-590 block block_id_595 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="595">“Once,” said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, “I was a real Turtle.”</p><p class="p-591 block block_id_596 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="596">These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an occasional exclamation of “Hjckrrh!” from the Gryphon, and the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and saying, “Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,” but she could not help thinking there&nbsp;<em>must</em>&nbsp;be more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.</p><p class="p-592 block block_id_597 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="597">“When we were little,” the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, “we went to school in the sea. The master was an old Turtle—we used to call him Tortoise—”</p><p class="p-593 block block_id_598 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="598">“Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn’t one?” Alice asked.</p><p class="p-594 block block_id_599 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="599">“We called him Tortoise because he taught us,” said the Mock Turtle angrily: “really you are very dull!”</p><p class="p-595 block block_id_600 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="600">“You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,” added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, “Drive on, old fellow! Don’t be all day about it!” and he went on in these words:</p><p class="p-596 block block_id_601 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="601">“Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn’t believe it—”</p><p class="p-597 block block_id_602 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="602">“I never said I didn’t!” interrupted Alice.</p><p class="p-598 block block_id_603 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="603">“You did,” said the Mock Turtle.</p><p class="p-599 block block_id_604 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="604">“Hold your tongue!” added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again. The Mock Turtle went on.</p><p class="p-600 block block_id_605 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="605">“We had the best of educations—in fact, we went to school every day—”</p><p class="p-601 block block_id_606 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="606">“<em>I’ve</em>&nbsp;been to a day-school, too,” said Alice; “you needn’t be so proud as all that.”</p><p class="p-602 block block_id_607 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="607">“With extras?” asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.</p><p class="p-603 block block_id_608 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="608">“Yes,” said Alice, “we learned French and music.”</p><p class="p-604 block block_id_609 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="609">“And washing?” said the Mock Turtle.</p><p class="p-605 block block_id_610 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="610">“Certainly not!” said Alice indignantly.</p><p class="p-606 block block_id_611 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="611">“Ah! then yours wasn’t a really good school,” said the Mock Turtle in a tone of great relief. “Now at&nbsp;<em>ours</em>&nbsp;they had at the end of the bill, ‘French, music,&nbsp;<em>and washing</em>—extra.’”</p><p class="p-607 block block_id_612 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="612">“You couldn’t have wanted it much,” said Alice; “living at the bottom of the sea.”</p><p class="p-608 block block_id_613 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="613">“I couldn’t afford to learn it.” said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. “I only took the regular course.”</p><p class="p-609 block block_id_614 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="614">“What was that?” inquired Alice.</p><p class="p-610 block block_id_615 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="615">“Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,” the Mock Turtle replied; “and then the different branches of Arithmetic—Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.”</p><p class="p-611 block block_id_616 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="616">“I never heard of ‘Uglification,’” Alice ventured to say. “What is it?”</p><p class="p-612 block block_id_617 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="617">The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. “What! Never heard of uglifying!” it exclaimed. “You know what to beautify is, I suppose?”</p><p class="p-613 block block_id_618 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="618">“Yes,” said Alice doubtfully: “it means—to—make—anything—prettier.”</p><p class="p-614 block block_id_619 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="619">“Well, then,” the Gryphon went on, “if you don’t know what to uglify is, you&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;a simpleton.”</p><p class="p-615 block block_id_620 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="620">Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said “What else had you to learn?”</p><p class="p-616 block block_id_621 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="621">“Well, there was Mystery,” the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the subjects on his flappers, “—Mystery, ancient and modern, with Seaography: then Drawling—the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel, that used to come once a week:&nbsp;<em>he</em>&nbsp;taught us Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.”</p><p class="p-617 block block_id_622 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="622">“What was&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;like?” said Alice.</p><p class="p-618 block block_id_623 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="623">“Well, I can’t show it you myself,” the Mock Turtle said: “I’m too stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.”</p><p class="p-619 block block_id_624 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="624">“Hadn’t time,” said the Gryphon: “I went to the Classics master, though.

He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice. “Same as if he had a bone in his throat,” said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back.

Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating “<em>You are old, Father William</em>,” to the Caterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said “That’s very curious.”</p><p class="p-685 block block_id_690 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="690">“It’s all about as curious as it can be,” said the Gryphon.</p><p class="p-686 block block_id_691 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="691">“It all came different!” the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. “I should like to hear her try and repeat something now.

In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them—“I wish they’d get the trial done,” she thought, “and hand round the refreshments!” But there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about her, to pass away the time.</p><p class="p-718 block block_id_723 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="723">Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything there. “That’s the judge,” she said to herself, “because of his great wig.”</p><p class="p-719 block block_id_724 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="724">The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.</p><p class="p-720 block block_id_725 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="725">“And that’s the jury-box,” thought Alice, “and those twelve creatures,” (she was obliged to say “creatures,” you see, because some of them were animals, and some were birds,) “I suppose they are the jurors.” She said this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. However, “jury-men” would have done just as well.</p><p class="p-721 block block_id_726 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="726">The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. “What are they doing?” Alice whispered to the Gryphon. “They can’t have anything to put down yet, before the trial’s begun.”</p><p class="p-722 block block_id_727 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="727">“They’re putting down their names,” the Gryphon whispered in reply, “for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.”</p><p class="p-723 block block_id_728 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="728">“Stupid things!” Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, “Silence in the court!” and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who was talking.</p><p class="p-724 block block_id_729 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="729">Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down “stupid things!” on their slates, and she could even make out that one of them didn’t know how to spell “stupid,” and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. “A nice muddle their slates’ll be in before the trial’s over!” thought Alice.</p><p class="p-725 block block_id_730 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="730">One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice could&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.</p><p class="p-726 block block_id_731 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="731">“Herald, read the accusation!” said the King.</p><p class="p-727 block block_id_732 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="732">On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:—</p><p class="p-728 block block_id_733 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="733"><em>“The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All on a summer day:<br>The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And took them quite away!”</em></p><p class="p-729 block block_id_734 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="734">“Consider your verdict,” the King said to the jury.</p><p class="p-730 block block_id_735 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="735">“Not yet, not yet!” the Rabbit hastily interrupted. “There’s a great deal to come before that!”</p><p class="p-731 block block_id_736 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="736">“Call the first witness,” said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, “First witness!”</p><p class="p-732 block block_id_737 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="737">The first witness was the Hatter.

(The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)</p><p class="p-848 block block_id_853 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="853">“Then the words don’t&nbsp;<em>fit</em>&nbsp;you,” said the King, looking round the court with a smile. There was a dead silence.</p><p class="p-849 block block_id_854 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="854">“It’s a pun!” the King added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed, “Let the jury consider their verdict,” the King said, for about the twentieth time that day.</p><p class="p-850 block block_id_855 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="855">“No, no!” said the Queen. “Sentence first—verdict afterwards.”</p><p class="p-851 block block_id_856 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="856">“Stuff and nonsense!” said Alice loudly. “The idea of having the sentence first!”</p><p class="p-852 block block_id_857 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="857">“Hold your tongue!” said the Queen, turning purple.</p><p class="p-853 block block_id_858 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="858">“I won’t!” said Alice.</p><p class="p-854 block block_id_859 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="859">“Off with her head!” the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody moved.</p><p class="p-855 block block_id_860 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="860">“Who cares for you?” said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by this time.) “You’re nothing but a pack of cards!”</p><p class="p-856 block block_id_861 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="861">At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.</p><p class="p-857 block block_id_862 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="862">“Wake up, Alice dear!” said her sister; “Why, what a long sleep you’ve had!”</p><p class="p-858 block block_id_863 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="863">“Oh, I’ve had such a curious dream!” said Alice, and she told her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, “It&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;a curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it’s getting late.” So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.</p><p class="p-859 block block_id_864 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="864">But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:—</p><p class="p-860 block block_id_865 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="865">First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers—she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that&nbsp;<em>would</em>&nbsp;always get into her eyes—and still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sister’s dream.</p><p class="p-861 block block_id_866 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="866">The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by—the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool—she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution—once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the Duchess’s knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it—once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard’s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs, filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock Turtle.</p><p class="p-862 block block_id_867 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="867">So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all would change to dull reality—the grass would be only rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds—the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen’s shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy—and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard—while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle’s heavy sobs.</p><p class="p-863 block block_id_868 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="868">Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and make&nbsp;<em>their</em>&nbsp;eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.</p><p class="p-864 block block_id_869 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="869">THE END</p></div></div>
