That point of time must be when the constitutional power of appointment has been exercised. And the power has been exercised when the last act required from the person possessing the power has been performed. This last act is the signature of the commission.</p><p class="p-7 block block_id_7 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="7">If the act of livery be necessary to give validity to the commission of an officer, it has been delivered when executed, and given to the Secretary of State for the purpose of being sealed, recorded, and transmitted to the party.</p><p class="p-8 block block_id_8 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="8">In cases of commissions to public officers, the law orders the Secretary of State to record them.

But where a specific duty is assigned by law, and individual rights depend upon the performance of that duty, it seems equally clear that the individual who considers himself injured has a right to resort to the laws of his country for a remedy.</p><p class="p-10 block block_id_10 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="10">The President of the United States, by signing the commission, appointed Mr. Marbury a justice of the peace for the County of Washington, in the District of Columbia, and the seal of the United States, affixed thereto by the Secretary of State, is conclusive testimony of the verity of the signature, and of the completion of the appointment; and the appointment conferred on him a legal right to the office for the space of five years. Having this legal right to the office, he has a consequent right to the commission, a refusal to deliver which is a plain violation of that right for which the laws of the country afford him a remedy.</p><p class="p-11 block block_id_11 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="11">To render a mandamus a proper remedy, the officer to whom it is directed must be one to whom, on legal principles, such writ must be directed, and the person applying for it must be without any other specific remedy.</p><p class="p-12 block block_id_12 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="12">Where a commission to a public officer has been made out, signed, and sealed, and is withheld from the person entitled to it, an action of detinue for the commission against the Secretary of State who refuses to deliver it is not the proper remedy, as the judgment in detinue is for the thing itself, or its value. The value of a public office, not to be sold, is incapable of being ascertained. It is a plain case for a mandamus, either to deliver the commission or a copy of it from the record.</p><p class="p-13 block block_id_13 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="13">To enable the Court to issue a mandamus to compel the delivery of the commission of a public office by the Secretary of State, it must be shown that it is an exercise of appellate jurisdiction, or that it be necessary to enable them to exercise appellate jurisdiction.</p><p class="p-14 block block_id_14 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="14">It is the essential criterion of appellate jurisdiction that it revises and corrects the proceedings in a cause already instituted, and does not create the cause.</p><p class="p-15 block block_id_15 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="15">The authority given to the Supreme Court by the act establishing the judicial system of the United States to issue writs of mandamus to public officers appears not to be warranted by the Constitution.</p><p class="p-16 block block_id_16 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="16">It is emphatically the duty of the Judicial Department to say what the law is.

This motion was supported by affidavits of the following facts: that notice of this motion had been given to Mr. Madison; that Mr. Adams, the late President of the United States, nominated the applicants to the Senate for their advice and consent to be appointed justices of the peace of the District of Columbia; that the Senate advised and consented to the appointments; that commissions in due form were signed by the said President appointing them justices, &amp;c., and that the seal of the United States was in due form affixed to the said commissions by the Secretary of State; that the applicants have requested Mr. Madison to deliver them their said commissions, who has not complied with that request; and that their said commissions are withheld from them; that the applicants have made application to Mr. Madison as Secretary of State of the United States at his office, for information whether the commissions were signed and sealed as aforesaid; that explicit and satisfactory information has not been given in answer to that inquiry, either by the Secretary of State or any officer in the Department of State; that application has been made to the secretary of the Senate for a certificate of the nomination of the applicants, and of the advice and consent of the Senate, who has declined giving such a certificate; whereupon a rule was made to show cause on the fourth day of this term.

For if he has been appointed, the law continues him in office for five years, and he is entitled to the possession of those evidences of office, which, being completed, became his property.</p><p class="p-46 block block_id_46 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="46">The second section of the second article of the Constitution declares,</p><p class="p-47 block block_id_47 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="47">"The President shall nominate, and, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and all other officers of the United States, whose appointments are not otherwise provided for."</p><p class="p-48 block block_id_48 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="48">The third section declares, that "He shall commission all the officers of the United States."</p><p class="p-49 block block_id_49 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="49">An act of Congress directs the Secretary of State to keep the seal of the United States,</p><p class="p-50 block block_id_50 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="50">"to make out and record, and affix the said seal to all civil commissions to officers of the United States to be appointed by the President, by and with the consent of the Senate, or by the President alone; provided that the said seal shall not be affixed to any commission before the same shall have been signed by the President of the United States."</p><p class="p-51 block block_id_51 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="51">These are the clauses of the Constitution and laws of the United States which affect this part of the case. They seem to contemplate three distinct operations:</p><p class="p-52 block block_id_52 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="52">1. The nomination. This is the sole act of the President, and is completely voluntary.</p><p class="p-53 block block_id_53 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="53">2. The appointment. This is also the act of the President, and is also a voluntary act, though it can only be performed by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.</p><p class="p-54 block block_id_54 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="54"><a id="156"></a>Page 5 U. S. 156</p><p class="p-55 block block_id_55 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="55">3. The commission. To grant a commission to a person appointed might perhaps be deemed a duty enjoined by the Constitution. "He shall," says that instrument, "commission all the officers of the United States."</p><p class="p-56 block block_id_56 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="56">The acts of appointing to office and commissioning the person appointed can scarcely be considered as one and the same, since the power to perform them is given in two separate and distinct sections of the Constitution. The distinction between the appointment and the commission will be rendered more apparent by adverting to that provision in the second section of the second article of the Constitution which authorises Congress</p><p class="p-57 block block_id_57 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="57">"to vest by law the appointment of such inferior officers as they think proper in the President alone, in the Courts of law, or in the heads of departments;"</p><p class="p-58 block block_id_58 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="58">thus contemplating cases where the law may direct the President to commission an officer appointed by the Courts or by the heads of departments. In such a case, to issue a commission would be apparently a duty distinct from the appointment, the performance of which perhaps could not legally be refused.</p><p class="p-59 block block_id_59 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="59">Although that clause of the Constitution which requires the President to commission all the officers of the United States may never have been applied to officers appointed otherwise than by himself, yet it would be difficult to deny the legislative power to apply it to such cases. Of consequence, the constitutional distinction between the appointment to an office and the commission of an officer who has been appointed remains the same as if in practice the President had commissioned officers appointed by an authority other than his own.</p><p class="p-60 block block_id_60 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="60">It follows too from the existence of this distinction that, if an appointment was to be evidenced by any public act other than the commission, the performance of such public act would create the officer, and if he was not removable at the will of the President, would either give him a right to his commission or enable him to perform the duties without it.</p><p class="p-61 block block_id_61 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="61">These observations are premised solely for the purpose of rendering more intelligible those which apply more directly to the particular case under consideration.</p><p class="p-62 block block_id_62 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="62"><a id="157"></a>Page 5 U. S. 157</p><p class="p-63 block block_id_63 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="63">This is an appointment made by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, and is evidenced by no act but the commission itself. In such a case, therefore, the commission and the appointment seem inseparable, it being almost impossible to show an appointment otherwise than by proving the existence of a commission; still, the commission is not necessarily the appointment; though conclusive evidence of it.</p><p class="p-64 block block_id_64 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="64">But at what stage does it amount to this conclusive evidence?</p><p class="p-65 block block_id_65 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="65">The answer to this question seems an obvious one. The appointment, being the sole act of the President, must be completely evidenced when it is shown that he has done everything to be performed by him.</p><p class="p-66 block block_id_66 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="66">Should the commission, instead of being evidence of an appointment, even be considered as constituting the appointment itself, still it would be made when the last act to be done by the President was performed, or, at furthest, when the commission was complete.</p><p class="p-67 block block_id_67 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="67">The last act to be done by the President is the signature of the commission. He has then acted on the advice and consent of the Senate to his own nomination. The time for deliberation has then passed. He has decided. His judgment, on the advice and consent of the Senate concurring with his nomination, has been made, and the officer is appointed. This appointment is evidenced by an open, unequivocal act, and, being the last act required from the person making it, necessarily excludes the idea of its being, so far as it respects the appointment, an inchoate and incomplete transaction.</p><p class="p-68 block block_id_68 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="68">Some point of time must be taken when the power of the Executive over an officer, not removable at his will, must cease. That point of time must be when the constitutional power of appointment has been exercised. And this power has been exercised when the last act required from the person possessing the power has been performed. This last act is the signature of the commission. This idea seems to have prevailed with the Legislature when the act passed converting the Department</p><p class="p-69 block block_id_69 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="69"><a id="158"></a>Page 5 U. S. 158</p><p class="p-70 block block_id_70 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="70">of Foreign Affairs into the Department of State. By that act, it is enacted that the Secretary of State shall keep the seal of the United States,</p><p class="p-71 block block_id_71 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="71">"and shall make out and record, and shall affix the said seal to all civil commissions to officers of the United States, to be appointed by the President: . . . provided that the said seal shall not be affixed to any commission before the same shall have been signed by the President of the United States, nor to any other instrument or act without the special warrant of the President therefor."</p><p class="p-72 block block_id_72 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="72">The signature is a warrant for affixing the great seal to the commission, and the great seal is only to be affixed to an instrument which is complete. It attests, by an act supposed to be of public notoriety, the verity of the Presidential signature.</p><p class="p-73 block block_id_73 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="73">It is never to be affixed till the commission is signed, because the signature, which gives force and effect to the commission, is conclusive evidence that the appointment is made.</p><p class="p-74 block block_id_74 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="74">The commission being signed, the subsequent duty of the Secretary of State is prescribed by law, and not to be guided by the will of the President. He is to affix the seal of the United States to the commission, and is to record it.</p><p class="p-75 block block_id_75 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="75">This is not a proceeding which may be varied if the judgment of the Executive shall suggest one more eligible, but is a precise course accurately marked out by law, and is to be strictly pursued. It is the duty of the Secretary of State to conform to the law, and in this he is an officer of the United States, bound to obey the laws. He acts, in this respect, as has been very properly stated at the bar, under the authority of law, and not by the instructions of the President. It is a ministerial act which the law enjoins on a particular officer for a particular purpose.</p><p class="p-76 block block_id_76 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="76">If it should be supposed that the solemnity of affixing the seal is necessary not only to the validity of the commission, but even to the completion of an appointment, still, when the seal is affixed, the appointment is made, and</p><p class="p-77 block block_id_77 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="77"><a id="159"></a>Page 5 U. S. 159</p><p class="p-78 block block_id_78 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="78">the commission is valid. No other solemnity is required by law; no other act is to be performed on the part of government. All that the Executive can do to invest the person with his office is done, and unless the appointment be then made, the Executive cannot make one without the cooperation of others.</p><p class="p-79 block block_id_79 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="79">After searching anxiously for the principles on which a contrary opinion may be supported, none has been found which appear of sufficient force to maintain the opposite doctrine.</p><p class="p-80 block block_id_80 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="80">Such as the imagination of the Court could suggest have been very deliberately examined, and after allowing them all the weight which it appears possible to give them, they do not shake the opinion which has been formed.</p><p class="p-81 block block_id_81 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="81">In considering this question, it has been conjectured that the commission may have been assimilated to a deed to the validity of which delivery is essential.</p><p class="p-82 block block_id_82 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="82">This idea is founded on the supposition that the commission is not merely evidence of an appointment, but is itself the actual appointment -- a supposition by no means unquestionable. But, for the purpose of examining this objection fairly, let it be conceded that the principle claimed for its support is established.</p><p class="p-83 block block_id_83 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="83">The appointment being, under the Constitution, to be made by the President personally, the delivery of the deed of appointment, if necessary to its completion, must be made by the President also. It is not necessary that the livery should be made personally to the grantee of the office; it never is so made. The law would seem to contemplate that it should be made to the Secretary of State, since it directs the secretary to affix the seal to the commission after it shall have been signed by the President. If then the act of livery be necessary to give validity to the commission, it has been delivered when executed and given to the Secretary for the purpose of being sealed, recorded, and transmitted to the party.</p><p class="p-84 block block_id_84 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="84">But in all cases of letters patent, certain solemnities are required by law, which solemnities are the evidences</p><p class="p-85 block block_id_85 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="85"><a id="160"></a>Page 5 U. S. 160</p><p class="p-86 block block_id_86 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="86">of the validity of the instrument. A formal delivery to the person is not among them. In cases of commissions, the sign manual of the President and the seal of the United States are those solemnities. This objection therefore does not touch the case.</p><p class="p-87 block block_id_87 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="87">It has also occurred as possible, and barely possible, that the transmission of the commission and the acceptance thereof might be deemed necessary to complete the right of the plaintiff.</p><p class="p-88 block block_id_88 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="88">The transmission of the commission is a practice directed by convenience, but not by law. It cannot therefore be necessary to constitute the appointment, which must precede it and which is the mere act of the President. If the Executive required that every person appointed to an office should himself take means to procure his commission, the appointment would not be the less valid on that account. The appointment is the sole act of the President; the transmission of the commission is the sole act of the officer to whom that duty is assigned, and may be accelerated or retarded by circumstances which can have no influence on the appointment. A commission is transmitted to a person already appointed, not to a person to be appointed or not, as the letter enclosing the commission should happen to get into the post office and reach him in safety, or to miscarry.</p><p class="p-89 block block_id_89 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="89">It may have some tendency to elucidate this point to inquire whether the possession of the original commission be indispensably necessary to authorize a person appointed to any office to perform the duties of that office. If it was necessary, then a loss of the commission would lose the office. Not only negligence, but accident or fraud, fire or theft might deprive an individual of his office. In such a case, I presume it could not be doubted but that a copy from the record of the Office of the Secretary of State would be, to every intent and purpose, equal to the original. The act of Congress has expressly made it so. To give that copy validity, it would not be necessary to prove that the original had been transmitted and afterwards lost. The copy would be complete evidence that the original had existed, and that the appointment had been made, but not that the original had been transmitted. If indeed it should appear that</p><p class="p-90 block block_id_90 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="90"><a id="161"></a>Page 5 U. S. 161</p><p class="p-91 block block_id_91 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="91">the original had been mislaid in the Office of State, that circumstance would not affect the operation of the copy. When all the requisites have been performed which authorize a recording officer to record any instrument whatever, and the order for that purpose has been given, the instrument is in law considered as recorded, although the manual labour of inserting it in a book kept for that purpose may not have been performed.</p><p class="p-92 block block_id_92 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="92">In the case of commissions, the law orders the Secretary of State to record them. When, therefore, they are signed and sealed, the order for their being recorded is given, and, whether inserted in the book or not, they are in law recorded.</p><p class="p-93 block block_id_93 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="93">A copy of this record is declared equal to the original, and the fees to be paid by a person requiring a copy are ascertained by law. Can a keeper of a public record erase therefrom a commission which has been recorded?

It has been created by special act of Congress, and has been secured, so far as the laws can give security to the person appointed to fill it, for five years. It is not then on account of the worthlessness of the thing pursued that the injured party can be alleged to be without remedy.</p><p class="p-120 block block_id_120 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="120">Is it in the nature of the transaction?

Is it to be contended that where the law, in precise terms, directs the performance of an act in which an individual is interested, the law is incapable of securing obedience to its mandate?

It is further enacted that all patents shall be countersigned by the Secretary of State, and recorded in his office. If the Secretary of State should choose to withhold this patent, or, the patent being lost, should refuse a copy of it, can it be imagined that the law furnishes to the injured person no remedy?</p><p class="p-128 block block_id_128 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="128">It is not believed that any person whatever would attempt to maintain such a proposition.</p><p class="p-129 block block_id_129 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="129">It follows, then, that the question whether the legality of an act of the head of a department be examinable in a court of justice or not must always depend on the nature of that act.</p><p class="p-130 block block_id_130 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="130">If some acts be examinable and others not, there must be some rule of law to guide the Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction.</p><p class="p-131 block block_id_131 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="131">In some instances, there may be difficulty in applying the rule to particular cases; but there cannot, it is believed, be much difficulty in laying down the rule.</p><p class="p-132 block block_id_132 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="132">By the Constitution of the United States, the President is invested with certain important political powers, in the</p><p class="p-133 block block_id_133 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="133"><a id="166"></a>Page 5 U.

To aid him in the performance of these duties, he is authorized to appoint certain officers, who act by his authority and in conformity with his orders.</p><p class="p-135 block block_id_135 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="135">In such cases, their acts are his acts; and whatever opinion may be entertained of the manner in which executive discretion may be used, still there exists, and can exist, no power to control that discretion. The subjects are political. They respect the nation, not individual rights, and, being entrusted to the Executive, the decision of the Executive is conclusive. The application of this remark will be perceived by adverting to the act of Congress for establishing the Department of Foreign Affairs. This officer, as his duties were prescribed by that act, is to conform precisely to the will of the President. He is the mere organ by whom that will is communicated. The acts of such an officer, as an officer, can never be examinable by the Courts.</p><p class="p-136 block block_id_136 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="136">But when the Legislature proceeds to impose on that officer other duties; when he is directed peremptorily to perform certain acts; when the rights of individuals are dependent on the performance of those acts; he is so far the officer of the law, is amenable to the laws for his conduct, and cannot at his discretion, sport away the vested rights of others.</p><p class="p-137 block block_id_137 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="137">The conclusion from this reasoning is that, where the heads of departments are the political or confidential agents of the Executive, merely to execute the will of the President, or rather to act in cases in which the Executive possesses a constitutional or legal discretion, nothing can be more perfectly clear than that their acts are only politically examinable. But where a specific duty is assigned by law, and individual rights depend upon the performance of that duty, it seems equally clear that the individual who considers himself injured has a right to resort to the laws of his country for a remedy.</p><p class="p-138 block block_id_138 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="138">If this be the rule, let us inquire how it applies to the case under the consideration of the Court.</p><p class="p-139 block block_id_139 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="139"><a id="167"></a>Page 5 U.

When he has made an appointment, he has exercised his whole power, and his discretion has been completely applied to the case. If, by law, the officer be removable at the will of the President, then a new appointment may be immediately made, and the rights of the officer are terminated. But as a fact which has existed cannot be made never to have existed, the appointment cannot be annihilated, and consequently, if the officer is by law not removable at the will of the President, the rights he has acquired are protected by the law, and are not resumable by the President. They cannot be extinguished by Executive authority, and he has the privilege of asserting them in like manner as if they had been derived from any other source.</p><p class="p-141 block block_id_141 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="141">The question whether a right has vested or not is, in its nature, judicial, and must be tried by the judicial authority.

The subsequent part of the section is mere surplusage -- is entirely without meaning -- if such is to be the construction.

Or, in other words, though it be not law, does it constitute a rule as operative as if it was a law? This would be to overthrow in fact what was established in theory, and would seem, at first view, an absurdity too gross to be insisted on. It shall, however, receive a more attentive consideration.</p><p class="p-229 block block_id_229 body outline-level-7" data-block-index="229">It is emphatically the province and duty of the Judicial Department to say what the law is.
